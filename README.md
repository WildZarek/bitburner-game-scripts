# Bitburner Game Scripts

Welcome to my personal scripts for [Bitburner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/).
They are written using the in-game language of NetscriptJS, which is a mutation of Javascript.

If you want to play the game itself - click on the name above.

## Requirements

The script has been modified to be able to start on 8 GB (the default starting RAM for a player) on the `home` server.
Obviously, when you expand the memory available, you'll get extra perks - being able to buy and manage player-owned servers,
as well as using spare RAM to do actions. The script can be slow to get going, but it'll get there eventually.
Getting access to more port hackers will improve the performance.

## Install

1. Make sure you're on your home server (you can quickly go home by running `home` in the console).
2. Paste the following command:

```javascript
wget(`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WildZarek/bitburner-game-scripts/master/install.js`, "install.js")
```

3. Write in console: `run install.js`

Now you are ready to run each script you need. Note this scripts are for an early game status.
